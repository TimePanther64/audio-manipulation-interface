# stereo-to-ambisonic
A GUI which gives users the option to convert either a single stereo audio file to an ambisonic audio file 
or do a batch conversion of several audio files with a few extra features integrated. 

The first is a volume slider which allows the user to change the volume of an audio file.
The second is a reverberation slider
The third is a bass slider
The forth is a treble slider

The batch conversion uses multiprocessing to speed up the process

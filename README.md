# audio-manipulation-interface
A GUI which gives users the option to convert either a single stereo audio file to an ambisonic audio file 
or perform a batch conversion of several audio files with a few extra features integrated. 

The GUI is divided into three tabs:

1. The first tab contains the interface that facilitates the audio conversion section of the code.
2. The second tab contains sliders that change several characteristics of the code; volume(-36 to 36), bass(2 to 12), treble(2 to 12) and reverb(15 to 30)
3. The third tab is a very basic ad remover that removes ads from the begining and end of an audio file
